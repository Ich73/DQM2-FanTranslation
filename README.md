# DQM2-FanTranslation
This repository is a place to develop fan translations for _Dragon Quest Monsters 2: Cobi and Tara's Marvelous Mysterious Key_ for several different languages. It contains only `.xdelta` and `.patJ` patch files so no copyrighted material is shared.  

## Structure
The folder structure in this repository is based on the structure of extracted `.cia` or `.3ds` files.  
Most foldernames consist of the basename of the folder and the locale of the translation, e.g. `Message_EN` contains the messages for the english language. Folders without a locale extension are used for every language except for the original language japanese.  
  
The content of the folders is as follows:
  * `Banner` contains the logo that is shown on the top screen in the 3DS home menu (see [Editing the Banner](https://github.com/Ich73/DQM2-FanTranslation/wiki/Editing-the-Banner))
  * `Event` contains `.e` files storing the story and dialog texts (see [Editing .e Files](https://github.com/Ich73/DQM2-FanTranslation/wiki/Editing-.e-Files))
  * `Font` contains the `.bcfnt` fonts that are used in game (see [Editing .bcfnt Files](https://github.com/Ich73/DQM2-FanTranslation/wiki/Editing-.bcfnt-Files))
  * `Layout` contains `.arc` archives storing `.bclim` images for icons, pictures, frames, etc. (see [Editing .arc Files](https://github.com/Ich73/DQM2-FanTranslation/wiki/Editing-.arc-Files))
  * `Message` contains `.binJ` files storing texts that can be edited using [BinJ Editor](https://github.com/Ich73/BinJEditor) (see [Editing .binJ Files](https://github.com/Ich73/DQM2-FanTranslation/wiki/Editing-.binJ-Files))
  * `NaviMap` contains `.arc` archives storing `.bclim` images for icons, pictures, frames, etc. (see [Editing .arc Files](https://github.com/Ich73/DQM2-FanTranslation/wiki/Editing-.arc-Files))
